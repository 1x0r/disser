  Abstract                 = {We formulate the optimal control problem for a class of nonlinear objects that can be represented as objects with linear structure and state-dependent coefficients. We assume that the system is subjected to uncontrollable bounded disturbances. The linear structure of the transformed nonlinear system and the quadratic quality functional let us, in the optimal control synthesis, to pass from Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations to a state-dependent Riccati equation. Control of nonlinear uncertain object in the problem of moving along a given trajectory is considered using the theory of differential games. We also give an example that illustrates how theoretical results of this work can be used. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper assesses the new numerical-constant generation method called ephemeral constant, which can be seen as a translation of the classical genetic programming's ephemeral random constant to the grammatical evolution framework. Its most distinctive feature is that it decouples the number of bits used to encode the grammar's production rules from the number of bits used to represent a constant. This makes it possible to increase the method's representational power without incurring in an overly redundant encoding scheme. We present experiments comparing ephemeral constant with the three most popular approaches for constant handling: the traditional approach, digit concatenation, and persistent random constant. By varying the number of bits to represent a constant, we can increase the numerical precision to the desired level of accuracy, overcoming by a large margin the other approaches. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a stochastic approach for comprehensive diagnostics and validation of control system architecture for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Mathematically based diagnostics of a 6 DoF system provides capability for a complex evaluation of system components behaviour, but are typically both memory and computationally expensive. Design and optimisation of the flight controllers is a demanding task which usually requires deep engineering knowledge of intrinsic aircraft behaviour. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are known for their robustness for a wide range of optimising functions, when no a priori knowledge of the search space is available. Thus it makes evolutionary approach a promising technique to design the task controllers for complex dynamic systems such as an aircraft. In this study, EAs are used to design a controller for recovery (landing) of a small fixed-wing UAV on a frigate ship deck. The control laws are encoded in a way common for Evolutionary Programming. However, parameters (numeric coefficients in the control equations) are optimised independently using effective Evaluation Strategies, while structural changes occur at a slower rate. The fitness evaluation Is made via test runs on a comprehensive 6 degree-of-freedom non-linear UAV model. The need of a well defined approach to the control system validation is dictated by the nature of UAV application, where the major source of mission success is based on autonomous control system architecture reliability. The results show that an effective controller can be designed with little knowledge of the aircraft dynamics using appropriate evolutionary techniques. An evolved controller is evaluated and a set of reliable algorithm parameters is validated. ©2007 IEEE.},

The layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that moves in the office areas of a laboratory, building maps of its surroundings and using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

Current solutions tend to lead to unnecessarily complex solutions that only work in niche environments.

Grammatical evolution (GE) is a recent evolutionary algorithm that has been applied to various problems, particularly those for which GP has performed. We formulate robot control as vector-valued function estimation and present a novel generative grammar for vector-valued functions. A consideration of the crossover operator leads us to propose a design criterion for the application of GE to vector-valued function estimation, along with a second novel generative grammar which meets this criterion. The suitability of these grammars for vector-valued function estimation is assessed empirically on a simulated task for the Khepera robot. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) is a challenging task in data mining and machine learning. Each instance in HMC can be classified into two or more classes simultaneously. These classes are structured in a hierarchy, in the form of either a tree or a directed acyclic graph. Therefore, an instance can be assigned to two or more paths from the hierarchical structure, resulting in a complex classification problem with hundreds or thousands of classes. Several methods have been proposed to deal with such problems, including several algorithms based on well-known bio-inspired techniques, such as neural networks, ant colony optimization, and genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel global method called GEHM, which makes use of grammatical evolution for generating HMC rules. In this approach, the grammatical evolution algorithm evolves the antecedents of classification rules, in order to assign instances from a HMC dataset to a probabilistic class vector. Our method is compared to bio-inspired HMC algorithms in protein function prediction datasets. The empirical analysis conducted in this work shows that GEHM outperforms the bio-inspired algorithms with statistical significance, which suggests that grammatical evolution is a promising alternative to deal with hierarchical multi-label classification of biological data. © 2013 IEEE.},

The created functions are written in the simple "number-string" language JB, and in TB, a modified version of JB with a tree-like structure. These languages have the feature that they can be used to represent well-formed, useful computer programs while still being amenable to suitably defined genetic operators. The system isused to produce two-input, single-output multiplication functions that are concise and well-defined. Future work, dealing with extensions to more complicated functions and generalizations of the techniques, is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurate load prediction plays a major role in devising effective power system control strategies. Successful prediction systems often use machine learning (ML) methods. The success of ML methods, among other things, depends on a suitable choice of input features which are usually selected by domain-experts. In this paper, we propose a novel systematic way of generating and selecting better features for daily peak electricity load prediction using kernel methods. Grammatical evolution is used to evolve an initial population of well performing individuals, which are subsequently mapped to feature subsets derived from wavelets and technical indicator type formulae used in finance. It is shown that the generated features can improve results, while requiring no domain-specific knowledge. The proposed method is focused on feature generation and can be applied to a wide range of ML architectures and applications. © 2013 IEEE.},

It is shown that the solution of the synthesis problem for one given initial state may not provide conservation of the optimal value of the functional under vari ation of the initial state. A problem of control synthesis is formulated, in which it is necessary to find an optimal control for initial values belonging to a given region. It is proved that if the region of initial values is discrete and contains a finite number of points, then a solution to this synthesis problem exists. To solve the synthesis problem, a constructive computational method is proposed, based on the network operator. An example of solving an applied control synthesis problem is presented. © 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

It investigates why two typical initialisation schemes (random bit and ramped half and half) produce very different, but in each case skewed, tree types. A third methodology, Sean Luke's Probabilistic Tree-Creation version 2 (PTC2), is also examined and is shown to produce a wider variety of trees. Two experiments on different problem sets are carried out and it is shown that for each of these test cases, where the "wrong" initialisation method is utilised, the chance of achieving a successful run is decreased even if the runs are continued long enough for the populations to stagnate. This would seem to suggest that the system does not typically recover from a "bad" start. © 2010 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {Area exploration and mapping with teams of robots is a challenging application. As the complexity of this application increases so does the challenge of designing effective coordinated control. One potential solution to this problem is to explore some relevant parts of the design space automatically. In this paper, we present an approach which uses Grammatical Evolution to design a control function for coordinated path planning of teams of mobile robots. Simulation results are promising with evolved control functions showing performance better than handwritten control in term of amount of explored area. © 2011 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an Attribute Grammar with Lookahead (AG+LA) approach, a technique to solve heavily constrained Multiple Knapsack Problem. This approach incorporates a form of lookahead into the mapping process of Grammatical Evolution (GE) using Attribute Grammar (AG) to focus only on feasible solutions, thereby avoiding issues such as repeated remapping and introns, both of which are limitations of previous approaches based on AG. We also present AG+LAE (AG+LA with an efficiency measure to bias the search towards the most efficient, i. e., best value, objects), the successor of AG+LA where a biasing process is incorporated using problem specific knowledge to significantly improve the performance of its predecessor, both in terms of the number of evaluations required and the quality of solutions obtained. Degenerate code, as used in DNA, is code that uses redundancy, so that different codons can represent the same thing. Many developmental systems, such as GE, use a degenerate encoding to help promote neutral mutations, that is, minor genetic changes that do not result in a phenotypic change. While early work in GE suggested that some level of degeneracy was important, it does come at the cost of increasing the size of the search space. Duplicate Elimination techniques, as opposed to degenerate encoding, are employed in decoder-based Evolutionary Algorithms to ensure that the newly generated solutions are not already contained in the current population. The results and analysis show that it is crucial to incorporate duplicate elimination to improve the performance of both approaches, while the reduced level of degeneracy is crucial only for AG+LA. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  Abstract                 = {Although genetic algorithms, like neural networks, are seemingly inappropriate for handling symbolically oriented problems, recent work in the fields of both the genetic algorithm and neural network argues otherwise. This presentation will discuss a group of seemingly different problems from symbolic processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning which can be solved using genetic algorithms if the appropriate representation scheme and appropriate modifications to the repertoire of genetic operations are adopted.
 The approaches used in applying genetic algorithms to such symbolic problems may shed light on the problem of applying neural networks to symbolic problems.
 Many problems from symbolic processing appear to be inappropriate candidates for solution via genetic algorithms because they, in effect, require discovery of a computer program that produces some desired output value when presented with particular inputs. However, with an appropriate representation scheme and appropriate modifications of the traditional genetic operations, it is possible to genetically search the space of possible computer programs for a most fit individual computer program. In this new {"}genetic programming{"} paradigm, populations of computer programs (LISP symbolic expressions) are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs.
 Depending on the terminology of the particular field of interest, the {"}computer program{"} may be called a robotic action plan, an optimal control strategy, a decision tree, an econometric model, a game-playing strategy, the state transition equations, the transfer function, or, perhaps merely, a composition of functions. Similarly, the {"}inputs{"} to the {"}computer program{"} may be called sensor values, state variables, independent variables, attributes of an object, or, perhaps more prosaically, the arguments to a function.
 The methods for applying genetic algorithms to symbolic problems are illustrated using examples from the areas of function learning, robotic planning, symbolic function identification, symbolic regression, symbolic integration and differentiation, symbolic solution of differential equations, game-playing, sequence induction, empirical discovery and econometric modeling, concept formation, automatic programming , pattern recognition, time-optimal control. Problems of the type described above can be expeditiously solved only if the flexibility found in computer programs is available. This flexibility includes the ability to perform alternative computations conditioned on the outcome of intermediate calculations, to perform computations on variables of many different types, to perform iterations and recursions to achieve the desired result, and to define and subsequently use computed values and sub-programs.
 The process of solving these problems can be reformulated as a search for a most fit individual computer program in the space of possible computer programs composed of various terms (atoms) along with standard arithmetic operations, standard programming operations, standard mathematical functions, and various functions peculiar to the given problem domain. Four types of objects are manipulated as we build computer programs, namely, functions of various number of arguments; variable atoms; constant atoms; and control structures such as If-Then-Else, Do-Until, etc.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal in automatic programming is to get a computer to perform a task by telling it what needs to be done, rather than by explicitly programming it. This paper considers the task of automatically generating a computer program to enable an autonomous mobile robot to perform the task of moving a box from the middle of an irregular shaped room to the wall. We compare the ability of the recently developed genetic programming paradigm to produce such a program to the reported ability of reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q learning, to produce such a program in the style of the subsumption architecture. The computational requirements of reinforcement learning necessitates considerable human knowledge and intervention, whereas genetic programming comes much closer to achieving the goal of getting the computer to perform the task without explicitly programming it. The solution produced by genetic programming emerges as a result of Darwinian natural selection and genetic crossover (sexual recombination) in a population of computer programs. The process is driven by a fitness measure which communicates the nature of the task to the computer and its learning paradigm.},

  Abstract                 = {Grammatical Evolution (GE) is one of the evolutionary algorithms to find functions and programs, which can deal according to a syntax with tree structure by one-dimensional chromosome of Genetic Algorithm. An original GE starts from the definition of the syntax by means of Backus Naur Form (BNF). Chromosome in binary number is translated to that in decimal number. The BNF syntax selects according to the remainder of the decimal number with respect to the total number of candidate rules. In this study, we will introduce three schemes for improving the convergence property of the original GE. In numerical examples, the original GE is compared in function identification problem with the Genetic Programming (GP), which is one of the most popular evolutionary algorithm to find unknown functions or programs. Three algorithms are compared in Santa Fe trail problem and prediction problem of Nikkei stock average, which finds programs to control artificial ants collecting foods. The results show that the efficiency of schemes depends on the problem to be solved and that the schemes 1 and 2 are effective for Santa Fe trail problem and prediction problem of Nikkei stock average, respectively. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {We present a method to solve initial and boundary value problems using artificial neural networks. A trial solution of the differential equation is written as a sum of two parts. The first part satisfies the initial/boundary conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is constructed so as not to affect the initial/boundary conditions. This part involves a feedforward neural network containing adjustable parameters (the weights). Hence by construction the initial/boundary conditions are satisfied and the network is trained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this approach ranges from single ordinary differential equations (ODE's), to systems of coupled ODE's and also to partial differential equations (PDE's). In this article, we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model problems and present comparisons with solutions obtained using the Galekrkin finite element method for several cases of partial differential equations. With the advent of neuroprocessors and digital signal processors the method becomes particularly interesting due to the expected essential gains in the execution speed. © 1998 IEEE.},

  Abstract                 = {A computer language is a very general form of representing and specifying an autonomous agent's behavior. The task of planning feasible actions could then simply be reduced to an instance of automatic programming. We have evaluated the use of an evolutionary technique for automatic programming called Genetic Programming (GP) to directly control a miniature robot. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to control a real robot with a GP based learning method. Two schemes are presented. The objective of the GP system in our first approach is to evolve real-time obstacle avoiding behavior. This technique enables real-time learning with a real robot using genetic programming. It has, however, the drawback that the learning time is limited by the response dynamics of the environment. To overcome this problem we have devised a second method, learning from past experiences which are stored in memory. This new system allows a speed-up of the algorithm by a factor of more than 2000. Obstacle avoiding behavior emerges much faster, approximately 40 times as fast, allowing learning of this task in 1.5 minutes. This learning time is several orders of magnitude faster than in comparable experiments with other control architectures. Furthermore, the GP algorithm is very compact and can be ported to the micro-controller of the autonomous mobile miniature robot.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel evolutionary approach to robotic control of a real robot based on genetic programming (GP). Our approach uses GP techniques that manipulate machine code to evolve control programs for robots. This variant of GP has several advantages over a conventional GP system, such as higher speed, lower memory requirements, and better real-time properties. Previous attempts to apply GP in robotics use simulations to evaluate control programs and have difficulties with learning tasks involving a real robot. We present an on-line control method that is evaluated in two different physical environments and applied to two tasks - obstacle avoidance and object following - using the Khepera robot platform. The results show fast learning and good generalization.},

Instead the genome is used to specify which nonterminal will be developed next, in addition to specifying the rule that will be applied to that nonterminal. Results suggest that the adoption of a more flexible mapping process where the order of non-terminal expansion is not determined a-priori, but instead itself evolved, is beneficial for Grammatical Evolution. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

This novel operator is inspired by GE’s ability to create genetic diversity without causing changes in the phenotype. Neutral mutation happens naturally in the algorithm; however, forcing such changes increases success rates in symbolic regression problems profoundly with very low additional CPU and memory cost. By exploiting the genotype-phenotype mapping, this additional mutation operator allows the algorithm to explore the search space more efficiently by keeping constant genetic diversity in the population which increases the mutation potential. The NMO can be applied in combination with any other genetic operator or even different search algorithms (e.g. Differential Evolution or Particle Swarm Optimization) for GE and works especially well in small populations and larger problems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

This general design principle of search operators in evolutionary algorithms is either known as locality or geometry of search operators, respectively. It takes a geometric perspective on search operators and suggests that the distance between an offspring and its parents should be less than or equal to the distance between both parents. This paper examines the locality of standard search operators used in grammatical evolution (GE) and genetic programming (GP) for binary tree problems. Both standard GE and GP search operators suffer from low locality since a substantial number of search steps result in an offspring whose distance to one of its parents is greater than the distance between both of its parents. Furthermore, the locality of standard GE search operators is higher than that of standard GP search operators, which allows more focused search in GE. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

  Abstract                 = {Genetic programming (GP) has problems with structural difficulty as it is unable to search effectively for solutions requiring very full or very narrow trees. As a result of structural difficulty, GP has a bias towards narrow trees which means it searches effectively for solutions requiring narrow trees. This paper focuses on the structural difficulty of grammatical evolution (GE). In contrast to GP, GE works on variable-length binary strings and uses a grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to map linear genotypes to phenotype trees. The paper studies whether and how GE is affected by structural difficulty. For the analysis, we perform random walks through the search space and compare the structure of the visited solutions. In addition, we compare the performance of GE and GP for the Lid problem. Results show that GE representation is biased, this means it has problems with structural difficulty. For binary trees, GE has a bias towards narrow and deep structures; thus GE outperforms standard GP if optimal solutions are composed of very narrow and deep structures. In contrast, problems where optimal solutions require more dense trees are easier to solve for GP than for GE. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},
