abstract = {Social behaviour is mainly based on swarm colonies, in which each individual shares its knowledge about the environment with other individuals to get optimal solutions. Such co-operative model differs from competitive models in the way that individuals die and are born by combining information of alive ones. This paper presents the particle swarm optimization with differential evolution algorithm in order to train a neural network instead the classic back propagation algorithm. The performance of a neural network for particular problems is critically dependant on the choice of the processing elements, the net architecture and the learning algorithm. This work is focused in the development of methods for the evolutionary design of artificial neural networks. This paper focuses in optimizing the topology and structure of connectivity for these networks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A fast learning neuroevolutionary algorithm for both feedforward and recurrent networks is proposed. The method is inspired by the well known and highly effective Cartesian genetic programming (CGP) technique. The proposed method is called the CGP-based Artificial Neural Network (CGPANN). The basic idea is to replace each computational node in CGP with an artificial neuron, thus producing an artificial neural network. The capabilities of CGPANN are tested in two diverse problem domains. Firstly, it has been tested on a standard benchmark control problem: single and double pole for both Markovian and non-Markovian cases. Results demonstrate that the method can generate effective neural architectures in substantially fewer evaluations in comparison to previously published neuroevolutionary techniques. In addition, the evolved networks show improved generalization and robustness in comparison with other techniques. Secondly, we have explored the capabilities of CGPANNs for the diagnosis of Breast Cancer from the FNA (Finite Needle Aspiration) data samples. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm gives 99.5{\%} accurate results, thus making it an excellent choice for pattern recognitions in medical diagnosis, owing to its properties of fast learning and accuracy. The power of a CGP based ANN is its representation which leads to an efficient evolutionary search of suitable topologies. This opens new avenues for applying the proposed technique to other linear/non-linear and Markovian/non-Markovian control and pattern recognition problems. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The framework presented uses ``blind'' evolutionary intelligence to synthesise shape grammar sentences i.e. Grammatical Evolution (GE), where rules are selected by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). This is a novel approach to automate the Shape Grammar (SG) formalism. We then present an application of a grammar based shape generative framework to solve a 2D design optimisation problem. This involves synthesis of parametric 2D curves where the shape grammar primitives are introduced as arcs represented by rotation and a radius. The efficacy of the proposed shape generative framework is then compared with that of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) parametrisation for structural optimisation.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a Neutral Mutation Operator (NMO) for Grammatical Evolution (GE). This novel operator is inspired by GE's ability to create genetic diversity without causing changes in the phenotype. Neutral mutation happens naturally in the algorithm; however, forcing such changes increases success rates in symbolic regression problems profoundly with very low additional CPU and memory cost. By exploiting the genotype-phenotype mapping, this additional mutation operator allows the algorithm to explore the search space more efficiently by keeping constant genetic diversity in the population which increases the mutation potential. The NMO can be applied in combination with any other genetic operator or even different search algorithms (e.g. Differential Evolution or Particle Swarm Optimization) for GE and works especially well in small populations and larger problems. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract = {Grammatical evolution (GE) is a form of grammar-based genetic programming. A particular feature of GE is that it adopts a distinction between the genotype and phenotype similar to that which exists in nature by using a grammar to map between the genotype and phenotype. Two variants of genotype representation are found in the literature, namely, binary and integer forms. For the first time we analyse and compare these two representations to determine if one has a performance advantage over the other. As such this study seeks to extend our understanding of GE by examining the impact of different genotypic representations in order to determine whether certain representations, and associated diversity-generation operators, improve GE's efficiency and effectiveness. Four mutation operators using two different representations, binary and gray code representation, are investigated. The differing combinations of representation and mutation operator are tested on three benchmark problems. The results provide support for the use of an integer-based genotypic representation as the alternative representations do not exhibit better performance, and the integer representation provides a statistically significant advantage on one of the three benchmarks. In addition, a novel wrapping operator for the binary and gray code representations is examined, and it is found that across the three problems examined there is no general trend to recommend the adoption of an alternative wrapping operator. The results also back up earlier findings which support the adoption of wrapping. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The utility of crossover in GP systems has been hotly debated for some time, and this debate has also arisen with respect to Grammatical Evolution. This paper serves to continue an analysis of the crossover operator in Grammatical Evolution by looking at the result of turning off crossover, and by exchanging randomly generated blocks in a headless chicken-like crossover. Results show that crossover in Grammatical Evolution is essential on the problem domains examined. The mechanism of one-point crossover in Grammatical Evolution is discussed, resulting in the discovery of some interesting properties that could yield an insight into the operator's success.},

abstract = {This paper describes a stochastic approach for comprehensive diagnostics and validation of control system architecture for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Mathematically based diagnostics of a 6 DoF system provides capability for a complex evaluation of system components behaviour, but are typically both memory and computationally expensive. Design and optimisation of the flight controllers is a demanding task which usually requires deep engineering knowledge of intrinsic aircraft behaviour. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are known for their robustness for a wide range of optimising functions, when no a priori knowledge of the search space is available. Thus it makes evolutionary approach a promising technique to design the task controllers for complex dynamic systems such as an aircraft. In this study, EAs are used to design a controller for recovery (landing) of a small fixed-wing UAV on a frigate ship deck. The control laws are encoded in a way common for Evolutionary Programming. However, parameters (numeric coefficients in the control equations) are optimised independently using effective Evaluation Strategies, while structural changes occur at a slower rate. The fitness evaluation Is made via test runs on a comprehensive 6 degree-of-freedom non-linear UAV model. The need of a well defined approach to the control system validation is dictated by the nature of UAV application, where the major source of mission success is based on autonomous control system architecture reliability. The results show that an effective controller can be designed with little knowledge of the aircraft dynamics using appropriate evolutionary techniques. An evolved controller is evaluated and a set of reliable algorithm parameters is validated. {\textcopyright}2007 IEEE.},

As a result of control synthesis we obtain a multi-dimensional function that describes the dependence of control on the object state. After the implementation of this function in the control unit of the real object, it achieves the goal of control with optimal value of the quality criteria. To solve the identification and synthesis problems we use the method of network operator, which with the help of evolutionary algorithms finds the structure and parameters of the functions describing the model and functional dependence of control from the object state.

abstract = {Although genetic algorithms, like neural networks, are seemingly inappropriate for handling symbolically oriented problems, recent work in the fields of both the genetic algorithm and neural network argues otherwise. This presentation will discuss a group of seemingly different problems from symbolic processing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning which can be solved using genetic algorithms if the appropriate representation scheme and appropriate modifications to the repertoire of genetic operations are adopted.
The approaches used in applying genetic algorithms to such symbolic problems may shed light on the problem of applying neural networks to symbolic problems.
Many problems from symbolic processing appear to be inappropriate candidates for solution via genetic algorithms because they, in effect, require discovery of a computer program that produces some desired output value when presented with particular inputs. However, with an appropriate representation scheme and appropriate modifications of the traditional genetic operations, it is possible to genetically search the space of possible computer programs for a most fit individual computer program. In this new {\{}"{\}}genetic programming{\{}"{\}} paradigm, populations of computer programs (LISP symbolic expressions) are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs.
Depending on the terminology of the particular field of interest, the {\{}"{\}}computer program{\{}"{\}} may be called a robotic action plan, an optimal control strategy, a decision tree, an econometric model, a game-playing strategy, the state transition equations, the transfer function, or, perhaps merely, a composition of functions. Similarly, the {\{}"{\}}inputs{\{}"{\}} to the {\{}"{\}}computer program{\{}"{\}} may be called sensor values, state variables, independent variables, attributes of an object, or, perhaps more prosaically, the arguments to a function.
The methods for applying genetic algorithms to symbolic problems are illustrated using examples from the areas of function learning, robotic planning, symbolic function identification, symbolic regression, symbolic integration and differentiation, symbolic solution of differential equations, game-playing, sequence induction, empirical discovery and econometric modeling, concept formation, automatic programming , pattern recognition, time-optimal control. Problems of the type described above can be expeditiously solved only if the flexibility found in computer programs is available. This flexibility includes the ability to perform alternative computations conditioned on the outcome of intermediate calculations, to perform computations on variables of many different types, to perform iterations and recursions to achieve the desired result, and to define and subsequently use computed values and sub-programs.
The process of solving these problems can be reformulated as a search for a most fit individual computer program in the space of possible computer programs composed of various terms (atoms) along with standard arithmetic operations, standard programming operations, standard mathematical functions, and various functions peculiar to the given problem domain. Four types of objects are manipulated as we build computer programs, namely, functions of various number of arguments; variable atoms; constant atoms; and control structures such as If-Then-Else, Do-Until, etc.},

Instead the genome is used to specify which nonterminal will be developed next, in addition to specifying the rule that will be applied to that nonterminal. Results suggest that the adoption of a more flexible mapping process where the order of non-terminal expansion is not determined a-priori, but instead itself evolved, is beneficial for Grammatical Evolution. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, many different genetic algorithms (GAs) have been introduced for solving optimization problems. Due to the variability of the characteristics in different optimization problems, none of these algorithms has shown consistent performance over a range of real world problems. The success of any GA depends on the design of its search operators, as well as their appropriate integration. In this paper, we propose a GA with a new multi-parent crossover. In addition, we propose a diversity operator to be used instead of mutation and also maintain an archive of good solutions. Although the purpose of the proposed algorithm is to cover a wider range of problems, it may not be the best algorithm for all types of problems. To judge the performance of the algorithm, we have solved aset of constrained optimization benchmark problems, as well as 14 well-known engineering optimization problems. The experimental analysis showed that the algorithm converges quickly to the optimal solution and thus exhibits a superior performance in comparison to other algorithms that also solved those problems.},

The convergent solutions can be achieved by selecting suitable PSO parameters regardless of the initial guess of the switching times.

Since the size of analog circuit is becoming larger and more complex, the design is becoming more and more difficult.

Corresponding to the two-layer GP, a new representation of circuit has been proposed here and it is more helpful to generate expectant circuit graphs. This algorithm can evolve the circuits with dynamical size, circuit topology, and component values.

Three algorithms are compared in Santa Fe trail problem and prediction problem of Nikkei stock average, which finds programs to control artificial ants collecting foods.

For said purpose, a database has been developed with 1831 mixes obtained from 81 papers. Firstly, in this manner, these properties have been compared with those of conventional concrete. Then, the need to adapt the prediction code expressions (adjusted for conventional concretes) was analyzed to take into account the use of recycled concrete, developing, if finally necessary, the correction coefficients which allow engineers to predict the recycled properties with the same approximation degree as in conventional concretes. These correction coefficients have been adjusted using multivariable regression, and have been analyzed using different statistical indexes. Lastly, specific expressions used to predict these properties in structural recycled concretes have been optimized. Two different tools have been used to develop these expressions: multivariable regression and genetic programming. The proposed expressions have been analysed using statistical parameters which have been compared with those obtained using the expressions proposed by other authors. In this regard, and finally, the best prediction expressions for the modulus of elasticity and the splitting tensile strength of structural recycled concretes have been proposed.},

Therefore, an instance can be assigned to two or more paths from the hierarchical structure, resulting in a complex classification problem with hundreds or thousands of classes. Several methods have been proposed to deal with such problems, including several algorithms based on well-known bio-inspired techniques, such as neural networks, ant colony optimization, and genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel global method called GEHM, which makes use of grammatical evolution for generating HMC rules. In this approach, the grammatical evolution algorithm evolves the antecedents of classification rules, in order to assign instances from a HMC dataset to a probabilistic class vector. Our method is compared to bio-inspired HMC algorithms in protein function prediction datasets. The empirical analysis conducted in this work shows that GEHM outperforms the bio-inspired algorithms with statistical significance, which suggests that grammatical evolution is a promising alternative to deal with hierarchical multi-label classification of biological data. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

@article{Poli2003,
abstract = {This paper is the second part of a two-part paper which introduces a general schema theory for genetic programming (GP) with subtree-swapping crossover (Part I (Poli and McPhee, 2003)). Like other recent GP schema theory results, the theory gives an exact formulation (rather than a lower bound) for the expected number of instances of a schema at the next generation. The theory is based on a Cartesian node reference system, introduced in Part I, and on the notion of a variable-arity hyperschema, introduced here, which generalises previous definitions of a schema. The theory includes two main theorems describing the propagation of GP schemata: a microscopic and a macroscopic schema theorem. The microscopic version is applicable to crossover operators which replace a subtree in one parent with a subtree from the other parent to produce the offspring. Therefore, this theorem is applicable to Koza's GP crossover with and without uniform selection of the crossover points, as well as one-point crossover, size-fair crossover, strongly-typed GP crossover, context-preserving crossover and many others. The macroscopic version is applicable to crossover operators in which the probability of selecting any two crossover points in the parents depends only on the parents' size and shape. In the paper we provide examples, we show how the theory can be specialised to specific crossover operators and we illustrate how it can be used to derive other general results. These include an exact definition of effective fitness and a size-evolution equation for GP with subtree-swapping crossover.},

We have defined three problems regarding the observed system: the first is the so-called grey box identification where we search for the characteristic of the system's valve, the second problem is black box identification where we search the model of the system with the usage of system's measurements and the third one is a system's controller design. We solved these problems with the usage of genetic algorithms, differential evolution, evolutionary strategies, genetic programming and a developed approach called AMEBA algorithm. All methods have been proven to be very useful for solving problems of the grey box identification and design of the controller for the mentioned system but AMEBA algorithm have also been successfully used in black box identification problem where it generated a suitable model.},

abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving perfor- mance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recog- nition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

The application of Grammatical Evolution, a grammar-based form of Genetic Programming (GP), has shown that it is capable of generating innovative engineering designs. Existing truss optimization methods in GP focus primarily on optimizing global topology. The standard method is to explore the search space while seeking minimum cross-sectional areas for all elements. In doing so, critical knowledge of section geometry and orientation is omitted, leading to inaccurate stress calculations and structures not meeting codes of practice. This can be addressed by constraining the optimisation method to only use standard construction elements. The aim of this paper is not to find fully optimized solutions, but rather to show that solutions very close to the theoretical optimum can be achieved using real-world elements. This methodology can be applied to any structural engineering design which can be generated by a grammar.},

abstract = {We present an investigation into crossover in Grammatical Evolution that begins by examining a biologically-inspired homologous crossover operator that is compared to standard one and two-point operators. Results demonstrate that this homologous operator is no better than the simpler one-point operator traditionally adopted. An analysis of the effectiveness of one-point crossover is then conducted by determining the effects of this operator, by adopting a headless chicken-type crossover that swaps randomly generated fragments in place of the evolved strings. Experiments show detrimental effects with the utility of the headless chicken operator. Finally, the mechanism of crossover in GE is analysed and termed ripple crossover, due to its defining characteristics. An experiment is described where ripple crossover is applied to tree-based genetic programming, and the results show that ripple crossover is more effective in exploring the search space of possible programs than sub-tree crossover by examining the rate of premature convergence during the run. Ripple crossover produces populations whose fitness increases gradually over time, slower than, but to an eventual higher level than that of sub-tree crossover.},

@article{Zojaji2016,
abstract = {Schema theory is the most well-known model of evolutionary algorithms. Imitating from genetic algorithms (GA), nearly all schemata defined for genetic programming (GP) refer to a set of points in the search space that share some syntactic characteristics. In GP, syntactically similar individuals do not necessarily have similar semantics. The instances of a syntactic schema do not behave similarly, hence the corresponding schema theory becomes unreliable. Therefore, these theories have been rarely used to improve the performance of GP. The main objective of this study is to propose a schema theory which could be a more realistic model for GP and could be potentially employed for improving GP in practice. To achieve this aim, the concept of semantic schema is introduced. This schema partitions the search space according to semantics of trees, regardless of their syntactic variety. We interpret the semantics of a tree in terms of the mutual information between its output and the target. The semantic schema is characterized by a set of semantic building blocks and their joint probability distribution. After introducing the semantic building blocks, an algorithm for finding them in a given population is presented. An extraction method that looks for the most significant schema of the population is provided. Moreover, an exact microscopic schema theorem is suggested that predicts the expected number of schema samples in the next generation. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the proposed schema definition in representing the semantics of the schema instances. It is also revealed that the semantic schema theorem estimation is more realistic than previously defined schemata.},

The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that moves in the office areas of a laboratory, building maps of its surroundings and using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

abstract = {We present a method to solve initial and boundary value problems using artificial neural networks. A trial solution of the differential equation is written as a sum of two parts. The first part satisfies the initial/boundary conditions and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part is constructed so as not to affect the initial/boundary conditions. This part involves a feedforward neural network containing adjustable parameters (the weights). Hence by construction the initial/boundary conditions are satisfied and the network is trained to satisfy the differential equation. The applicability of this approach ranges from single ordinary differential equations (ODE's), to systems of coupled ODE's and also to partial differential equations (PDE's). In this article, we illustrate the method by solving a variety of model problems and present comparisons with solutions obtained using the Galekrkin finite element method for several cases of partial differential equations. With the advent of neuroprocessors and digital signal processors the method becomes particularly interesting due to the expected essential gains in the execution speed. {\textcopyright} 1998 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a nonlinear system identification technique based on multi-dimensional rational polynomials. A multi-dimensional Pade-Legendre approximation is developed to circumvent challenges in dealing with sharp shocks. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the accuracy of such approximations for identification of various nonlinear systems, particularly systems with a non-smooth response surface. This identification approach utilizes the generalized form of a Pade-Legendre approximation for studying multivariable functions. In the studied problems, the nonlinearity is a function of state variables (displacement and velocity), which requires multi-dimensional formulation. Furthermore, a spatial filter is applied to minimize the effects of the singular points in the applicable rational function of the response surface. This study presents different types of nonlinearities including smooth, irregular, and hysteretic functions, in order to demonstrate the performance of the approach under different conditions. In order to study the robustness of the method in comparison to other identification techniques based on plain polynomial representation, a nonlinear system with a sharp discontinuous restoring force surface is considered. The performance of both approaches is investigated for different degrees of "sharpness". In addition, the accuracy of the identified models to represent the nonlinear system is verified by comparing the output of the system (computed on the basis of the identified model) from data sets corresponding to different excitations than those used for identification purposes. It is shown that the proposed approach provides a robust identification technique for a broad class of highly-nonlinear systems, and it is particularly advantageous to use when dealing with systems incorporating discontinuous properties.},

abstract = {The most important problems with exploiting artificial neural networks (ANNs) are to design the network topology, which usually requires an excessive amount of expert's effort, and to train it. In this paper, a new evolutionary-based algorithm is developed to simultaneously evolve the topology and the connection weights of ANNs by means of a new combination of grammatical evolution (GE) and genetic algorithm (GA). GE is adopted to design the network topology while GA is incorporated for better weight adaptation. The proposed algorithm needs to invest a minimal expert's effort for customization and is capable of generating any feedforward ANN with one hidden layer. Moreover, due to the fact that the generalization ability of an ANN may decrease because of overfitting problems, the algorithm utilizes a novel adaptive penalty approach to simplify ANNs generated through the evolution process. As a result, it produces much simpler ANNs that have better generalization ability and are easy to implement. The proposed method is tested on some real world classification datasets, and the results are statistically compared against existing methods in the literature. The results indicate that our algorithm outperforms the other methods and provides the best overall performance in terms of the classification accuracy and the number of hidden neurons. The results also present the contribution of the proposed penalty approach in the simplicity and generalization ability of the generated networks.},

Symbolic regression is a useful method to construct the data-driven model (regression equation). Existing algorithms for symbolic regression such as genetic programming and grammatical evolution are difficult to use due to their special target programming language (i.e.; LISP) or additional function parsing process. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm, parse-matrix evolution (PME), for symbolic regression is proposed. A chromosome in PME is a parse-matrix with integer entries. The mapping process from the chromosome to the regression equation is based on a mapping table. PME can easily be implemented in any programming language and free to control. Furthermore, it does not need any additional function parsing process. Numerical results show that PME can solve the symbolic regression problems effectively. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A genetic algorithm (GA) evolves a Lindenmayer System (L-System) that is used to design the neural network's architecture. This basic neural codification confers scalability and search space reduction in relation to other methods. Furthermore, the system uses a parallel genome scan engine that increases both the implicit parallelism and convergence of the GA. The fitness function of the NEA rewards economical artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are easily implemented. The NEA was tested on five real-world classification datasets and three well-known datasets for time series forecasting (TSF). The results are statistically compared against established state-of-the-art algorithms and various forecasting methods (ADANN, ARIMA, UCM, and Forecast Pro). In most cases, our NEA outperformed the other methods, delivering the most accurate classification and time series forecasting with the least computational effort. These superior results are attributed to the improved effectiveness and efficiency of NEA in the decision-making process. The result is an optimized neural network architecture for solving classification problems and simulating dynamical systems.},

Grammatical evolution (GE) is a recent evolutionary algorithm that has been applied to various problems, particularly those for which GP has performed. We formulate robot control as vector-valued function estimation and present a novel generative grammar for vector-valued functions. A consideration of the crossover operator leads us to propose a design criterion for the application of GE to vector-valued function estimation, along with a second novel generative grammar which meets this criterion. The suitability of these grammars for vector-valued function estimation is assessed empirically on a simulated task for the Khepera robot.},

abstract = {Offspring should be similar to their parents and inherit their relevant properties. This general design principle of search operators in evolutionary algorithms is either known as locality or geometry of search operators, respectively. It takes a geometric perspective on search operators and suggests that the distance between an offspring and its parents should be less than or equal to the distance between both parents. This paper examines the locality of standard search operators used in grammatical evolution (GE) and genetic programming (GP) for binary tree problems. Both standard GE and GP search operators suffer from low locality since a substantial number of search steps result in an offspring whose distance to one of its parents is greater than the distance between both of its parents. Furthermore, the locality of standard GE search operators is higher than that of standard GP search operators, which allows more focused search in GE. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

The MPG is composed of a network of neurons with weights determined by Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization. Staged evolution is used to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm. First, an oscilla- tor for the individual leg movements is evolved. Then, a network of these oscillators is evolved to coordinate the movements of the different legs. By introducing a staged set of manageable challenges, the algorithm's per- formance is improved.

The graph is encoded in the form of a linear string of integers. The inputs or terminal set and node outputs are numbered sequentially. The node functions are also separately numbered. The genotype is just a list of node connections and functions. The genotype is then mapped to an indexed graph that can be executed as a program. Evolutionary algorithms are used to evolve the genotype in a symbolic regression problem (sixth order polynomial) and the Santa Fe Ant Trail. The computational effort is calculated for both cases. It is suggested that hit effort is a more reliable measure of computational efficiency. A neutral search strategy that allows the fittest genotype to be replaced by another equally fit genotype (a neutral genotype) is examined and compared with non-neutral search for the Santa Fe ant problem.

We show the results when the proposed methodology is applied to model a magnetorheological damper, with real acquired data, and other two well-known benchmarks. The canonical genetic and differential evolution algorithms are used in cascade to decompose the problem of defining the lags taken as the inputs of the model and its related parameters based on the simultaneous minimization of the residuals and higher orders correlation functions. The inner layer of the cascaded approach is composed of a population which represents the lags on the inputs and outputs of the system and an outer layer represents the corresponding parameters of the RBFNN. The approach is able to define both the inputs of the model and its parameters. This is interesting as it frees the designer of manual procedures, which are time consuming and prone to error, usually done to define the model inputs. We compare the proposed methodology with other works found in the literature, showing overall better results for the cascaded approach.},

abstract = {A model that predicts the monthly water quality for a subtropical deep reservoir was constructed based on a newly developed programming system, the incremental grammatical evolution (IGE). IGE was designed to execute Grammatical Evolution (GE) by iteratively introducing the optimal solution until convergence, and to explore complex veiled relationships between inputs and outputs when physical models cannot be defined in advance. A disadvantage of traditional GE is that it tends to select the most significant input variables and may become trapped in a local optimum. The IGE adequately manages the large input dimensionality by incrementally expanding the search depth. From three IGE runs, we extracted four significant input variables from 15 input variables, including watershed chemical loads, precipitation, inflow, and outflow, and expressed them appropriately in a sophisticated mathematical manner with accepted complexity. The IGE-derived equation yields the optimal predictive capability, especially for peak total phosphorous (TP) values, compared to traditional multilinear regression (MLR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models. The sensitivity analyses reconfirm the effectiveness of the selected variables in the nonlinear mathematical equations. Although BPNN and IGE demonstrate similar performances, we preferred the latter because of its transparency in providing a formula with measurable parameters. After obtaining the IGE-derived model, a Macro-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) was applied to enhance searching efficiency and genetic diversity during optimization, and subsequently deduced the reduction rates of TP loads from various input sources to achieve the water quality requirement of the reservoir. This practice benefits the reservoir management by revealing the forcing functions that are manageable to prevent reservoir eutrophication. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its most distinctive feature is that it decouples the number of bits used to encode the grammar's production rules from the number of bits used to represent a constant. This makes it possible to increase the method's representational power without incurring in an overly redundant encoding scheme. We present experiments comparing ephemeral constant with the three most popular approaches for constant handling: the traditional approach, digit concatenation, and persistent random constant. By varying the number of bits to represent a constant, we can increase the numerical precision to the desired level of accuracy, overcoming by a large margin the other approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This paper presents an Attribute Grammar with Lookahead (AG+LA) approach, a technique to solve heavily constrained Multiple Knapsack Problem. This approach incorporates a form of lookahead into the mapping process of Grammatical Evolution (GE) using Attribute Grammar (AG) to focus only on feasible solutions, thereby avoiding issues such as repeated remapping and introns, both of which are limitations of previous approaches based on AG. We also present AG+LAE (AG+LA with an efficiency measure to bias the search towards the most efficient, i. e., best value, objects), the successor of AG+LA where a biasing process is incorporated using problem specific knowledge to significantly improve the performance of its predecessor, both in terms of the number of evaluations required and the quality of solutions obtained. Degenerate code, as used in DNA, is code that uses redundancy, so that different codons can represent the same thing. Many developmental systems, such as GE, use a degenerate encoding to help promote neutral mutations, that is, minor genetic changes that do not result in a phenotypic change. While early work in GE suggested that some level of degeneracy was important, it does come at the cost of increasing the size of the search space. Duplicate Elimination techniques, as opposed to degenerate encoding, are employed in decoder-based Evolutionary Algorithms to ensure that the newly generated solutions are not already contained in the current population. The results and analysis show that it is crucial to incorporate duplicate elimination to improve the performance of both approaches, while the reduced level of degeneracy is crucial only for AG+LA. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Grammars are an important tool for Evolutionary$\backslash$nComputation (EC). Grammars offer a flexible means of$\backslash$nsearch space restriction, and provide a mechanism for$\backslash$nimposing language and search biases. This thesis$\backslash$nexplores the use of a particular grammar type,$\backslash$nTree-Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) for use with Grammatical$\backslash$nEvolution (GE), a grammar-based EC algorithm. To date,$\backslash$nmuch of the work on GE has used Context-Free Grammars$\backslash$n(CFGs). TAGs have been shown to be more powerful than$\backslash$nCFGs and can generate some context-sensitive languages.$\backslash$nTAGs also exhibit interesting properties, such as, each$\backslash$nintermediate stage of TAG derivation being a fully$\backslash$nstructured feasible sentence from the language.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe focus of this thesis is to explore the use of TAGs$\backslash$nfor representation in GE. A definition of TAGs is given$\backslash$nand a comprehensive survey of TAGs in EC is presented.$\backslash$nFollowing this, a novel representation and mapping$\backslash$nprocess is developed which combines the linear$\backslash$nchromosome used by GE with TAGs. This extension of GE,$\backslash$ncalled Tree-Adjoining Grammatical Evolution (TAGE), is$\backslash$ncompared with canonical GE on a number of benchmark$\backslash$nproblems. TAGE demonstrates a performance benefit over$\backslash$nGE. Further study of the two representations is$\backslash$npresented, which identifies core representational$\backslash$ndifferences, such as, invalid individuals and neutral$\backslash$ncrossover operations, both of which do not occur in$\backslash$nTAGE. These differences are shown to account for some$\backslash$nof improved performance of TAGE.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSubsequent to this, a novel method of rendering search$\backslash$nlandscapes is presented. Single mutation event$\backslash$nlandscapes are generated for GE and TAGE for a number$\backslash$nof common grammars. It is shown that TAGE search spaces$\backslash$nare much more densely connected than those of GE,$\backslash$naffording TAGE greater opportunities to move about the$\backslash$nsearch space.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFurther representational differences in the form of$\backslash$npreferential language biases are discovered when$\backslash$ndeveloping methods of generating similar initial$\backslash$npopulations for both TAGE and GE. Two main biases are$\backslash$nidentified, adjunction constraints and grammar$\backslash$ntransformation biases. These biases affect the$\backslash$ndistributions of tree structures generated by TAGE.$\backslash$nMethods of mitigating these biases are presented and it$\backslash$nis shown that these biases can provide problem$\backslash$ndependent performance benefits.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe developmental nature of the feasibility property of$\backslash$nTAGs is exploited by integrating an on line artificial$\backslash$ngene regulatory network (GRN) model with TAGE in the$\backslash$nform of Developmental TAGE (DTAGE). DTAGE is shown to$\backslash$nimprove the usability of this GRN model by facilitating$\backslash$nit with the use of the TAGE mapping process. DTAGE is$\backslash$ndemonstrated to be capable of evolving GRNs whose$\backslash$noutput, when provided with feedback in the form of$\backslash$nstate information from dynamic problem environments,$\backslash$nmaps to phenotypes that can survive in those$\backslash$nenvironments.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn summary, this thesis explores the utility and$\backslash$ncapability of TAGs for representation in GE.$\backslash$nDifferences in representation between TAGs and CFGs for$\backslash$nuse with GE are identified and studied in terms of$\backslash$nperformance. TAGs are then exploited in the development$\backslash$nof a novel evolutionary developmental system combining$\backslash$nTAGs, GE and a GRN model.},

abstract = {A few schema theorems for genetic programming (GP) have been proposed in the literature in the last few years. Since they consider schema survival and disruption only, they can only provide a lower bound for the expected value of the number of instances of a given schema at the next generation rather than an exact value. This paper presents theoretical results for GP with one-point crossover which overcome this problem. First, we give an exact formulation for the expected number of instances of a schema at the next generation in terms of microscopic quantities. Due to this formulation we are then able to provide an improved version of an earlier GP schema theorem in which some (but not all) schema creation events are accounted for. Then, we extend this result to obtain an exact formulation in terms of macroscopic quantities which makes all the mechanisms of schema creation explicit. This theorem allows the exact formulation of the notion of effective fitness in GP and opens the way to future work on GP convergence, population sizing, operator biases, and bloat, to mention only some of the possibilities.},

abstract = {Genetic programming (GP) has problems with structural difficulty as it is unable to search effectively for solutions requiring very full or very narrow trees. As a result of structural difficulty, GP has a bias towards narrow trees which means it searches effectively for solutions requiring narrow trees. This paper focuses on the structural difficulty of grammatical evolution (GE). In contrast to GP, GE works on variable-length binary strings and uses a grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to map linear genotypes to phenotype trees. The paper studies whether and how GE is affected by structural difficulty. For the analysis, we perform random walks through the search space and compare the structure of the visited solutions. In addition, we compare the performance of GE and GP for the Lid problem. Results show that GE representation is biased, this means it has problems with structural difficulty. For binary trees, GE has a bias towards narrow and deep structures; thus GE outperforms standard GP if optimal solutions are composed of very narrow and deep structures. In contrast, problems where optimal solutions require more dense trees are easier to solve for GP than for GE. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

It investigates why two typical initialisation schemes (random bit and ramped half and half) produce very different, but in each case skewed, tree types. A third methodology, Sean Luke's Probabilistic Tree-Creation version 2 (PTC2), is also examined and is shown to produce a wider variety of trees. Two experiments on different problem sets are carried out and it is shown that for each of these test cases, where the "wrong" initialisation method is utilised, the chance of achieving a successful run is decreased even if the runs are continued long enough for the populations to stagnate. This would seem to suggest that the system does not typically recover from a "bad" start. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

This paper considers the task of automatically generating a computer program to enable an autonomous mobile robot to perform the task of moving a box from the middle of an irregular shaped room to the wall. We compare the ability of the recently developed genetic programming paradigm to produce such a program to the reported ability of reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q learning, to produce such a program in the style of the subsumption architecture. The computational requirements of reinforcement learning necessitates considerable human knowledge and intervention, whereas genetic programming comes much closer to achieving the goal of getting the computer to perform the task without explicitly programming it. The solution produced by genetic programming emerges as a result of Darwinian natural selection and genetic crossover (sexual recombination) in a population of computer programs. The process is driven by a fitness measure which communicates the nature of the task to the computer and its learning paradigm.},

Unlike a standard CPPN, the topology of a DPPN is evolved but the weights are learned. A Lamarckian algorithm, that combines evolution and learning, produces DPPNs to re-construct an image. Our main result is that DPPNs can be evolved/trained to compress the weights of a denoising autoencoder from 157684 to roughly 200 parameters, while achieving a reconstruction accuracy comparable to a fully connected network with more than two orders of magnitude more parameters. The regularization ability of the DPPN allows it to rediscover (approximate) convolutional network architectures embedded within a fully connected architec-ture. Such convolutional architectures are the current state of the art for many computer vision applications, so it is sat-isfying that DPPNs are capable of discovering this structure rather than having to build it in by design. DPPNs exhibit better generalization when tested on the Omniglot dataset after being trained on MNIST, than directly encoded fully connected autoencoders. DPPNs are therefore a new frame-work for integrating learning and evolution.},

abstract = {A computer language is a very general form of representing and specifying an autonomous agent's behavior. The task of planning feasible actions could then simply be reduced to an instance of automatic programming. We have evaluated the use of an evolutionary technique for automatic programming called Genetic Programming (GP) to directly control a miniature robot. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to control a real robot with a GP based learning method. Two schemes are presented. The objective of the GP system in our first approach is to evolve real-time obstacle avoiding behavior. This technique enables real-time learning with a real robot using genetic programming. It has, however, the drawback that the learning time is limited by the response dynamics of the environment. To overcome this problem we have devised a second method, learning from past experiences which are stored in memory. This new system allows a speed-up of the algorithm by a factor of more than 2000. Obstacle avoiding behavior emerges much faster, approximately 40 times as fast, allowing learning of this task in 1.5 minutes. This learning time is several orders of magnitude faster than in comparable experiments with other control architectures. Furthermore, the GP algorithm is very compact and can be ported to the micro-controller of the autonomous mobile miniature robot.},

abstract = {Bloat is one of the most widely studied phenomena in Genetic Programming (GP), it is normally defined as the increase in mean program size without a corresponding improvement in fitness. Several theories have been proposed in the specialized GP literature that explain why bloat occurs. In particular, the Crossover-Bias Theory states that the cause of bloat is that the distribution of program sizes during evolution is skewed in a way that encourages bloat to appear, by punishing small individuals and favoring larger ones. Therefore, several bloat control methods have been proposed that attempt to explicitly control the size distribution of programs within the evolving population. This work proposes a new bloat control method called neat-GP, that implicitly shapes the program size distribution during a GP run. neat-GP is based on two key elements: (a) the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm (NEAT), a robust heuristic that was originally developed to evolve neural networks; and (b) the Flat Operator Equalization bloat control method, that explicitly shapes the program size distributions toward a uniform or flat shape. Experimental results are encouraging in two domains, symbolic regression and classification of real-world data. neat-GP can curtail the effects of bloat without sacrificing performance, outperforming both standard GP and the Flat-OE method, without incurring in the computational overhead reported by some state-of-the-art bloat control methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we present application of genetic programming (GP) to evolution of indirect encoding of neural network weights. We compare usage of original HyperNEAT algorithm with our implementation, in which we replaced the underlying NEAT with genetic programming. The algorithm was named HyperGP. The evolved neural networks were used as controllers of autonomous mobile agents (robots) in simulation. The agents were trained to drive with maximum average speed. This forces them to learn how to drive on roads and avoid collisions. The genetic programming lacking the NEAT complexification property shows better exploration ability and tends to generate more complex solutions in fewer generations. On the other hand, the basic genetic programming generates quite complex functions for weights generation. Both approaches generate neural controllers with similar abilities.},

abstract = {Finding appropriate parameter values for Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) is one of the persistent challenges of Evolutionary Computing. In recent publications we showed how the REVAC (Relevance Estimation and VAlue Calibration) method is capable to find good EA parameter values for single problems. Here we demonstrate that REVAC can also tune an EA to a set of problems (a whole test suite). Hereby we obtain robust, rather than problem-tailored, parameter values and an EA that is a generalist, rather than a specialist. The optimized parameter values prove to be different from problem to problem and also different from the values of the generalist. Furthermore, we compare the robust parameter values optimized by REVAC with the supposedly robust conventional values and see great differences. This suggests that traditional settings might be far from optimal, even if they are meant to be robust.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Feature selection approaches have been widely applied to deal with the small sample size problem in the analysis of micro-array datasets. For the multiclass problem, the proposed methods are based on the idea of selecting a gene subset to distinguish all classes. However, it will be more effective to solve a multiclass problem by splitting it into a set of two-class problems and solving each problem with a respective classification system. RESULTS: We propose a genetic programming (GP)-based approach to analyze multiclass microarray datasets. Unlike the traditional GP, the individual proposed in this article consists of a set of small-scale ensembles, named as sub-ensemble (denoted by SE). Each SE consists of a set of trees. In application, a multiclass problem is divided into a set of two-class problems, each of which is tackled by a SE first. The SEs tackling the respective two-class problems are combined to construct a GP individual, so each individual can deal with a multiclass problem directly. Effective methods are proposed to solve the problems arising in the fusion of SEs, and a greedy algorithm is designed to keep high diversity in SEs. This GP is tested in five datasets. The results show that the proposed method effectively implements the feature selection and classification tasks.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms (GA) has given rise to two new fields of research where (global) optimisation is of crucial importance: ‘genetic based machine learning' (GBML) and ‘genetic programming' (GP). An introduction by the authors to GA and GBML was given in two previous papers (Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 9(6) (1996) 681; Eng. Appl. Artif. Intell. 13(4) (2000) 381). In this paper, the last domain (GP) will be introduced, thereby making up a trilogy which gives a general overview of the whole field. In this third part, an overview will be given of the basic concepts of GP as defined by Koza. A first (educational) example of GP is given by solving a simple symbolic regression of a sinus function. Finally, a more complex application is presented in which GP is used to construct the mathematical equations for an industrial process. To this end, the case study ‘fibre-to-yarn production process' is introduced. The goal of this study is the automatic development of mathematical equations for the prediction of spinnability and (possible) resulting yarn strength. It is shown that (relatively) simple equations can be obtained which describe accurately 90{\%} of the fibre-to-yarn database. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords:},

abstract = {Data-driven model is highly desirable for industrial data analysis in case the experimental model structure is unknown or wrong, or the concerned system has changed. Symbolic regression is a useful method to construct the data-driven model (regression equation). Existing algorithms for symbolic regression such as genetic programming and grammatical evolution are difficult to use due to their special target programming language (i.e.; LISP) or additional function parsing process. In this paper, a new evolutionary algorithm, parse-matrix evolution (PME), for symbolic regression is proposed. A chromosome in PME is a parse-matrix with integer entries. The mapping process from the chromosome to the regression equation is based on a mapping table. PME can easily be implemented in any programming language and free to control. Furthermore, it does not need any additional function parsing process. Numerical results show that PME can solve the symbolic regression problems effectively. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
